jelenacvsafskjgnsfvklmdc,.adlbkmnfvmsld,fkms,lvkmnjsd,lvmfknjdkmls,TEA operates on two 32-bit unsigned integers (could be derived from a 64-bit data block) and uses a 128-bit key. It has a Feistel structure with a suggested 64 rounds, typically implemented in pairs termed cycles. It has an extremely simple key schedule, mixing all of the key material in exactly the same way for each cycle. Different multiples of a magic constant are used to prevent simple attacks based on the symmetry of the rounds. The magic constant, 2654435769 or 0x9E3779B9 is chosen to be ⌊232/ϕ⌋, where ϕ is the golden ratio (as a Nothing-up-my-sleeve number).[4]

TEA has a few weaknesses. Most notably, it suffers from equivalent keys—each key is equivalent to three others, which means that the effective key size is only 126 bits.[5] As a result, TEA is especially bad as a cryptographic hash function. This weakness led to a method for hacking Microsoft's Xbox game console, where the cipher was used as a hash function.[6] TEA is also susceptible to a related-key attack which requires 223 chosen plaintexts under a related-key pair, with 232 time complexity.[2] Because of these weaknesses, the XTEA cipher was designed.TEA operates on two 32-bit unsigned integers (could be derived from a 64-bit data block) and uses a 128-bit key.
